# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Feature 2: Show/Hide Event Details

Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default

Given the user opens the event listing page, when the page loads, then all events are displayed in a collapsed state, showing only essential information such as event title, date, and location.

Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see details

Given the user is viewing the event list, when they tap or click on an event, then additional event details, such as description, venue, organizer information, and RSVP options, are revealed.

Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide details

Given an event is expanded, when the user taps or clicks on it again, then the event details collapse, showing only the essential information.

Feature 3: Specify Number of Events

Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 events are shown by default

Given the user has not set a preferred number of events, when they open the app, then 32 events are displayed in the event list.

Scenario 2: User can change the number of events displayed

Given the user navigates to the settings or preferences section, when they enter or select the desired number of events, then the app updates the event list accordingly and saves the preference.

Feature 4: Use the App When Offline

Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection

Given the user is offline, when they open the app, then previously cached event data is displayed with a notification informing the user they are viewing offline data.

Scenario 2: Show error when user changes search settings (city, number of events)

Given the user is offline, when they attempt to modify search settings (such as selecting a different city or changing the number of displayed events), then an error message appears stating search settings cannot be updated without an internet connection.

Feature 5: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen

Scenario 1: User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen

Given the user is using the app, when a prompt appears offering the option to install the app shortcut, then if they accept, the shortcut is added to their home screen.

Feature 6: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city

Given event data is available, when the user views the chart visualization, then a bar or pie chart displays the number of upcoming events per city, updating dynamically based on user preferences.
